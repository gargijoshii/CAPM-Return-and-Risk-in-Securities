# CAPM Return and Risk in Securities


This project involves a comprehensive analysis of stock performance using various financial metrics and machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to evaluate and optimize investment portfolios by using historical stock data.

## Key Features

- **Risk Assessment**: Utilized the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to calculate expected returns, beta, and alpha, offering insights into market volatility and excess returns.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implemented clustering algorithms to identify anomalies in stock performance, validated using silhouette scores for robustness.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzed the correlation between daily returns of different stocks to understand their interdependencies and market dynamics.
- **Rolling Beta Calculation**: Monitored the sensitivity of individual stocks to market movements over time using a rolling beta approach.
- **Forecasting**: Employed an ARIMA model to predict future stock prices based on historical data, enhancing investment decision-making.

## Conclusion

This project combines financial theory with data science to deliver actionable insights for investors, enabling better portfolio management and risk mitigation strategies.
